I love open source software. And Rust.

I like to understand what's going on under the hood for the software that I use, and make improvements that benefit both me and everyone else.

And Rust is the language which makes that fun for me, by enabling me to just jump into a codebase and hack on!

## Shoutouts

Most of the things I use, are Written in Rust™. Thank you:

- [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix), for being the reason I got into Rust in the first place. My first couple dozen Rust pull requests were sent here. It is my true editor ❤️
- [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) for being a static site generator that _just works_. This website is made with it, by the way.
- [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) for creating the most beautiful scripting language in existence, and being the shell where _everything just makes sense_.

Open source projects I'm _really excited_ about:

- [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) are cooking with each release, pushing Rust for the Frontend into reality. They put _so much_ effort into developer experience, and it really shows.
- [gitoxide](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide) is a pure-rust implementation of Git, and a gold mine of idiomatic Rust code. I had the pleasure of [integrating it with Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/13133) to provide inline git blame.

## My stuff

Open source projects:

- [ferrishot](https://ferrishot.com), a powerful cross-platform screenshot app[![ferrishot GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nik-rev/ferrishot)](https://github.com/nik-rev/ferrishot)
- [countryfetch](https://github.com/nik-rev/countryfetch) renders beautiful ASCII art of your country's flag, with additional information[![countryfetch GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nik-rev/countryfetch)](https://github.com/nik-rev/countryfetch)
- [patchy](https://github.com/nik-rev/patchy) automatically merges pull requests into your own fork. Useful for test-driving a bunch of pull requests and hot-swapping them with ease!
